<p align="justify:"><strong>Technology</strong></p>  

<p align="justify:"><strong>Proposed Technology Stack:</strong></p> 

<p align="justify"><strong>• Frontend</strong><strong>: </strong>For the front-end development we will use HTML and CSS. We will use HTML to define a structure of a web page and use CSS to style the web pages by using different styling features. We will try to use React and Material-UI for better frontend design.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>• Backend</strong><strong>: </strong>For the back-end development we will use PHP and JavaScript. We will also use REST API. To develop the better project, we will try Django if needed.</p>   

<p align="justify"><strong>• Database</strong><strong>: </strong>For the database aspect of this project, we will use Google Firebase. Firebase give us real-time database, login authentication and cloud storage facilities.</p>

<p align="justify:"><strong>Implemented Technology Stack:</strong></p>  

<p align="justify"><strong>• Frontend</strong><strong>: </strong>For the front-end development we used HTML and CSS. We used HTML to define a structure of a web page and use CSS to style the web pages by using different styling features. </p>

<p align="justify"><strong>• Backend</strong><strong>: </strong>For the back-end development we used JavaScript. JavaScript is a text-based programming language and it is user friendly. JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a 
user.
</p>   

<p align="justify"><strong>• Database</strong><strong>: </strong>For the database aspect of this project, we will use Google Firebase. Firebase give us real-time database, login authentication and cloud storage facilities.</p>

<p align="center">Fig 09: Database</p>

<p align="justify:"><strong>Monetization</strong></p> 
<p align="justify">We will charge 10% from service provider for every service. If the user pays via online, we will cut our percentage automatically. But if user pays through cash, service provider pays our charge via online.</p> 

<p align="justify:"><strong>Social Impacts</strong></p> 
<p align="justify"> This web application will aim to make finding suitable and better household service for home and office easier. People will get all type of household service in their hand. As all the service provider will be experienced and verified, so no worries about the quality of work.</p> 

<p align="justify:"><strong>Future works and Plan</strong></p> 
<p align="justify"> In future, we will extend our project and we will add some more services. Our main goal is that people will get all kinds of office and household services from this one web application. We would like to add the remaining services like: Beauty & Salon, Car Rental, Driver Service, Car Care Services, Security Guard and Ambulance Service.</p>

<p align="justify:"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> 
<p align="justify"> We wanted to develop a web application that would provide the user with a great online household service experience. People will be able to hire expert service providers through our website. The web application we created in this project can be improved. This is especially because we had to create it within a limited time. With more time, the web application can be improved to include security and different types of features and services. Learning processes and developing platforms was fun and time consuming. But the whole process, the development of the project was quite an experience for us.</p>
